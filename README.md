#

A mod that makes obtaining Eyes of Ender unreasonably difficult, and a later game task, requiring you reach the Ancient Cities, the Nether, and suffering from insomnia to obtain a new item, the End Catalyst.

This substance is very dangerous to anyone holding it and can kill the holder if handled for too long, only hold it on your person if you mean to use it.
