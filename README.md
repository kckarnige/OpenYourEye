This mod makes gaining access to the End dimension much more of a challenge, requiring you to reach the ancient cities, the Nether, as well as slay 2 withers.

This mod also adds a new crafting item: End Sludge

End Sludge is used to craft Eyes of Ender, with each crafting giving you two End Sludge.

End Sludge is a living substance that will attempt to kill you when on your person, decaying your body.    
Only hold onto it if you have the intention of using it.

Legends tell of a way to purify End Sludge for use with fast, near instant healing.
